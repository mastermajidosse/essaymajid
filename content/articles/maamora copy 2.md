I wrote a post about pitch compition being too bad

i'm watching pitch competitions lately and it seems the projects that win every time doesn't deserve even to be there

and the judges doesn't know what is a startup and don't qualify .. so i was wondering if we have an AI that make the dicision

or at least help the judges make a better one

Meanwhile i checked web summit 2018 with 3 finalist ..

The crowd selected by a majority 46% and 43% 2 of the 3 startups but the judges stood firm on the last one being the best and this really amaze me - because it was the best by huge margin

So it's not that the investors are not good to select startups like i thought but it's just a question of selecting a good investors to be judges in the first place , i'm sure we have great investors in middle east and north africa and ones that really invest in startups

not just in winning project and stable company income
