today i was at an event orgnized by accelab

they hosted Nora an international beach volleyball player hold four international gold medals for Morocco and African Champion

her story was one of the best stories i've ever heard an exeptional one and i would like to share it with everyone

i was listening and remembering haikyuu (anime) all over again

i love hearing struggle and faliure stories because they tap into reality and reprisant the lack of perfection and human accepct of life

not everyone is destined to succeed .. otherwise there won't be a second place and everyone will be a champion and a winner

she was a yong girl who liked sport she tried volley and like all people there was always that one coach who put you down

some coach in morocco told her you can't do it .. so she make it a life goal to prove him wrong (well nobody will admit this but proving people wrong is an amazing motive)

she went to study abroad and been to a team where a coach found that she's great at the position of libero

fast forward she went to USA and won some troffies she grow more confident and went to the most competitve place in USA

where she will be beaten by 16 years old girl even tho she was 25yo .. but she kept fighting there training with yonger girls

and participate in lot of compition

until morocco called her to represent the country and she made it and won the title

unfortunetly for some reason the World cup didn't happen that year

and after preparing for years and fighting for so long she participated in the next compition at the semi final the judge

either by mistake or in purpouse give a clear not valid point to the opposite team which turn out to be egype (duh)

when i heard that a flash back of all the defeats of football teams and national team came back in flash and on another

and to make the matter worse even when she is a champion she is not even getting paid .. so she had to work on shifts and train in the usa to represnet morocco - that was hard to hear athletes should focus on winning and making the flag go high

compitition she got injured and even with injury she continued until she won ..

this story was the definition of emotional rollercoaster

her story is so amazing it could be a movie and it will huge hit

all that being said she didn't achive her goal .. even tho she didn't say it i believe her biggest goal was the world cup

she said she's done with the stuggle and that she's getting injured too much with age

and i feel that inside she is in the last stand deep in her eye were a burning fire that said i'm still here to compete and win

if she take one step just one more step she can achieve her dream and be where she want to be

i doubt that unfirtunetly most likely she won't go back and get what she deserve

it;s a very sad amazing story

a movie

100% will be an amazing movie
