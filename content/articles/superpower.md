Always asked myself this question .
what if i can get anything i set my mind to , anything that is possible for a human being
what will be the best hack in life if anything is possible if you are limitless (within the realm of
possibility)

I read a lot of novels manga watched a lot of fictional stories so i have some past reference. <br><br>
There's one skill that kept being in my head .
this ability is called "Gamer's Mind" basiccaly it's 3 perk in one

- Calmly and logically think things through.
- Peaceful state of mind.
- immunity to mental disorder.

can you still feel sad, mad, and other emotions
