cost : usa and morocco
bereucracy : you need a 100 doc
fund / innovation : i know 2 guys with a very good idea a saas busnis make decent money ..
but they are slow with 30 costumer and they started
in the first quarter in 2020 . their monthly revenue 600$ now
regardless they are moving up if they got funds they will move a little faster
so why risking a big stupid idea (chatgpt african version) when you can give 1%
of that fund and accelerate an idea that already working and generating money

i remember a guy saying that he brainstormed a stupid idea (smart trash)
and won a big fund
from gov he wasn't even going to work on it .. - i didn't like that and i lost
respect for him i mean someone lost and had a real brilliant idea that could've
worked then he put that fund in his real startup and the worst thing moved to dubai

so our gov is litterly wasting money - that's assuming they are giving it
based on the project there is coruption everywhere and poor countries are the most
corrupt
