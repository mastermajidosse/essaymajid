No matter what we all suggest the answer is - its up to you.

A great master was asked, what is the best meditation? “The one that you do!”

If you are just starting out, you can sit for 20 minutes in the morning at the same time each day. Even five minutes is at least something - but not so useful as 20.

Think of it like this:

You put in 5 minutes - you get 5 minutes benefit

You put in 10 minutes - you get 15 minutes benefit

You put in 20 minutes - you get 40 minutes benefit

You put in 60 minutes - you get 5 hours benefit

One hour is long enough for one sitting.

Now here is the thing - it isn’t the length of time meditating that gives the benefit. Instead it is two other things:

    The length of time you stay in the meditative STATE and
    The sincere effort you made to actually sit and do meditation

For many decades I sat for one hour in the morning and 1/2 hour at night. Along with this I would sit with others to help them meditate. This could be an additional 1 to 4 hours a day.

So, in the beginning its hard, mostly because we have no idea of what we are receiving. So therefore, we don’t cherish it, we don’t value it as a priceless thing.

As you get into it more and more. It becomes very important to you. It becomes a catalyst for transformation. You realize that what it gives to you is a great gift that you keep opening again and again.

So, please do try to make a consistent effort for some length of time. Here is the practice I do. It is simple and very effective:

Morning::

Sit comfortably and relax.

Bring your awareness to your heart.

Make the thought that you are meditating on the source of light already present in the heart.

Feel it is attracting you inward.

If thoughts come - don't struggle with them. Gently return your awareness to the source of light in the heart and feel it is attracting you inwards.

You don't have to imagine light. Just wait to feel what is there.

All the best with your practice. If you want the free help of a trainer you can download the app - Let’s Meditate and sit with a person live for 30 minutes free. You can search Heartfulness and find it.
