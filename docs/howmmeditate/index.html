     <div style="color:grey; font-size:16px;">Wednesday, Jul 12, 2023</div>
     <div style="font-size:18px;"><p>No matter what we all suggest the answer is - its up to you.</p>
<p>A great master was asked, what is the best meditation? “The one that you do!”</p>
<p>If you are just starting out, you can sit for 20 minutes in the morning at the same time each day. Even five minutes is at least something - but not so useful as 20.</p>
<p>Think of it like this:</p>
<p>You put in 5 minutes - you get 5 minutes benefit</p>
<p>You put in 10 minutes - you get 15 minutes benefit</p>
<p>You put in 20 minutes - you get 40 minutes benefit</p>
<p>You put in 60 minutes - you get 5 hours benefit</p>
<p>One hour is long enough for one sitting.</p>
<p>Now here is the thing - it isn’t the length of time meditating that gives the benefit. Instead it is two other things:</p>
<pre><code>The length of time you stay in the meditative STATE and
The sincere effort you made to actually sit and do meditation
</code></pre>
<p>For many decades I sat for one hour in the morning and 1/2 hour at night. Along with this I would sit with others to help them meditate. This could be an additional 1 to 4 hours a day.</p>
<p>So, in the beginning its hard, mostly because we have no idea of what we are receiving. So therefore, we don’t cherish it, we don’t value it as a priceless thing.</p>
<p>As you get into it more and more. It becomes very important to you. It becomes a catalyst for transformation. You realize that what it gives to you is a great gift that you keep opening again and again.</p>
<p>So, please do try to make a consistent effort for some length of time. Here is the practice I do. It is simple and very effective:</p>
<p>Morning::</p>
<p>Sit comfortably and relax.</p>
<p>Bring your awareness to your heart.</p>
<p>Make the thought that you are meditating on the source of light already present in the heart.</p>
<p>Feel it is attracting you inward.</p>
<p>If thoughts come - don&rsquo;t struggle with them. Gently return your awareness to the source of light in the heart and feel it is attracting you inwards.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to imagine light. Just wait to feel what is there.</p>
<p>All the best with your practice. If you want the free help of a trainer you can download the app - Let’s Meditate and sit with a person live for 30 minutes free. You can search Heartfulness and find it.</p>
