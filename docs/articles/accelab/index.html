     <div style="color:grey; font-size:12px;margin-top: 30px;">Friday, Nov 15, 2024</div>
     <div style="font-size:18px;"><p>today i was at an event orgnized by accelab</p>
<p>they hosted Nora an international beach volleyball player hold four international gold medals for Morocco and African Champion</p>
<p>her story was one of the best stories i&rsquo;ve ever heard an exeptional one and i would like to share it with everyone</p>
<p>i was listening and remembering haikyuu (anime) all over again</p>
<p>i love hearing struggle and faliure stories because they tap into reality and reprisant the lack of perfection and human accepct of life</p>
<p>not everyone is destined to succeed .. otherwise there won&rsquo;t be a second place and everyone will be a champion and a winner</p>
<p>she was a yong girl who liked sport she tried volley and like all people there was always that one coach who put you down</p>
<p>some coach in morocco told her you can&rsquo;t do it .. so she make it a life goal to prove him wrong (well nobody will admit this but proving people wrong is an amazing motive)</p>
<p>she went to study abroad and been to a team where a coach found that she&rsquo;s great at the position of libero</p>
<p>fast forward she went to USA and won some troffies she grow more confident and went to the most competitve place in USA</p>
<p>where she will be beaten by 16 years old girl even tho she was 25yo .. but she kept fighting there training with yonger girls</p>
<p>and participate in lot of compition</p>
<p>until morocco called her to represent the country and she made it and won the title</p>
<p>unfortunetly for some reason the World cup didn&rsquo;t happen that year</p>
<p>and after preparing for years and fighting for so long she participated in the next compition at the semi final the judge</p>
<p>either by mistake or in purpouse give a clear not valid point to the opposite team which turn out to be egype (duh)</p>
<p>when i heard that a flash back of all the defeats of football teams and national team came back in flash and on another</p>
<p>and to make the matter worse even when she is a champion she is not even getting paid .. so she had to work on shifts and train in the usa to represnet morocco - that was hard to hear athletes should focus on winning and making the flag go high</p>
<p>compitition she got injured and even with injury she continued until she won ..</p>
<p>this story was the definition of emotional rollercoaster</p>
<p>her story is so amazing it could be a movie and it will huge hit</p>
<p>all that being said she didn&rsquo;t achive her goal .. even tho she didn&rsquo;t say it i believe her biggest goal was the world cup</p>
<p>she said she&rsquo;s done with the stuggle and that she&rsquo;s getting injured too much with age</p>
<p>and i feel that inside she is in the last stand deep in her eye were a burning fire that said i&rsquo;m still here to compete and win</p>
<p>if she take one step just one more step she can achieve her dream and be where she want to be</p>
<p>i doubt that unfirtunetly most likely she won&rsquo;t go back and get what she deserve</p>
<p>it;s a very sad amazing story</p>
<p>a movie</p>
<p>100% will be an amazing movie</p>
