     <h2>One reason why startups struggle to succeed in poor countries </h2>
     <br>


     <div style="color:grey; font-size:16px;">Sunday, Mar 5, 2023</div>
     <div style="font-size:18px;"><p>To start I have to quote paul graham when he wrote on a similar subject he said there&rsquo;s only one mistake that kills startups which is not making something users want If you make something users want, you&rsquo;ll probably be fine,</p>
<p>And i will say majority of people around the world don&rsquo;t get it from the first try especially the poor countries for a lot of reasons - i will take my own country morocco as a case</p>
<p>the one reason I beleive startups fail is Funds</p>
<p>To Give an example i know a co-founder with a very good idea a saas business that makes decent money
they don&rsquo;t have big numbers i guess now 30 costumer and they started in the first quarter of 2020 .
regardless they are growing each month and if they got funds they will grow even faster
and to be honest they didn&rsquo;t want a bank load nor business angel so they push many demands for a subsidy/competition a few times
and nothing happened , after many years i know that these type of funds are giving to the projects that are creative and innovative !</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my question why would any person that know just a little about the tech world give a big idea that will never work a huge amount of money (chatgpt moroccan version)
instead you can give 10% to a lot of startups that already working and generating money . give them the boost to grow faster and hire more people the quality will be better and if one succeeded it will start investing maybe the founders will start a space agency or a boring company you never know xD</p>
<p>To mention another example i remember a guy in a podcast saying that he brainstormed an idea and it was a smart trash or something like that
and won something from presenting it he wasn&rsquo;t even going to work on that idea , he himself said it was a stupid idea
then he put that fund in his real startup -&gt; cybersecurity company . moved to another country made a lot of money from his great company
he personally said all that in a podcast hosted by him
so presenting a cybersecurity wasn&rsquo;t an option for him nobody will think that&rsquo;s &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; but smart trash was !!
to give this guy credit he came back to morocco and started 2 companies here</p>
<p>So funds most of the time are wasted on innovative ideas that doesn&rsquo;t work / stupid and useless
i don&rsquo;t know how people judge these ideas . it&rsquo;s preferable to have tech entrepreneur or at least one tech in the jurry
if even that&rsquo;s not doable give them videos from shark tank they will for sure learn a lot
assuming they are giving fund sincerely to the people who deserve to get them</p>
